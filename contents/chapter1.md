# Introduction #

The following is Valuehorizon’s guide for the treatment of mutual fund data and performance measures. It will cover the basic concepts used in mutual fund analysis, as well as the standard methodologies to quantitatively compute the risks and returns of any fund.

This guide is based on three fundamental principles:

1. Performance data are computed from the perspective of the investor and not the fund manager. This has several implications which will be discussed throughout this guide.
2. Funds are analyzed according to their long term and short term performance. Valuehorizon defines the “long term” as the trailing thirty six (36) months and the “short term” as the trailing twelve (12) months or shorter.
3. The quantitative risk and return statistics of a fund are only meaningful when compared to the universe of funds or a subset of that universe. As a corollary, these statistics should be calculated in a manner that allows a fair and accurate comparison.

Valuehorizon collects raw fund data and stores them in a relational database. All raw data are linked to a verified source document. The data are of the following types:

* Price data - bid and offer net asset values and/or listed prices;
* Distribution data - distribution amounts or rates as well as the corresponding reinvestment or ex-distribution date;
* Financial statement data - Audited and unaudited financial statement data which are standardised for comparison.

All bibliographic references throughout this journal will be referred to in superscript, eg. x where x is an integer. They are included at the end of this methodology. All source documents throughout this journal will be referred to in encapsulated square brackets, eg [x] where x is an integer. They are included in Appendix B.

This methodology guide is a comprehensive reference for all data processing, computation, and presentations. The information and policies contained herein apply only to the April 2013 issue of the Valuehorizon Mutual Fund Journal, and may not apply to prior or future issues.  This guide also serves as the final reference for the Valuehorizon Online Fund Database™.
