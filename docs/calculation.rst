Calculation of Returns 
=========================

Valuehorizon calculates three returns for each fund - the Holding Period Return, the Effective Annualised Return and the Bond Equivalent Return. These returns are calculated for each calendar month, quarter and year.

Holding Period Return
=========================

The holding period return (also known as “HPR” or “unannualised total return”) over a specified time period is the return an investor would enjoy if he/she invested in the fund and reinvested all distributions during the period on their reinvestment dates. It also includes any unreinvested accrued distributions at the end of the period. This return is not load-adjusted. Furthermore, although the HPR is considered a bid-bid return, the distributions are invested at their applicable offer prices.

It is calculated as follows:

Where Pend is the fund bid price at the end of the period, Pstart is the fund bid price at the start of the period, Ni is the number of shares as at time i, Di is the fund’s ith distribution during the period, Pi is the fund’s offer price on the applicable distribution’s reinvestment date and Daccrued is the total outstanding accrued and unreinvested distributions.

From a practical perspective, the holding period return is mathematically equivalent to the return an investor would calculate using the opening and closing values on his/her fund account statement during the period assuming no funds are withdrawn or deposited and all distributions are reinvested by default.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

Where Vopen is the fund account’s opening value and Vclose is the fund account’s closing value.

Effective Annualised Return
==============================

One limitation of the holding period return is that it does not allow a fair comparison of two returns of different period lengths. The effective annualised return (also known as “EAR” or “annualised total return”) solves this problem by annualising the holding period return.

Given the number of days in the year n, and the number of days in the period t, it is calculated as follows:

Bond Equivalent Return
=========================

Some funds pay their distributions according to a rate applied to the investor’s holdings with a portion of the distribution being accrued daily. This rate is predetermined by the fund, and is known as the bond equivalent return (“BER”) or the bond equivalent yield (“BEY”). To allow an accurate comparison between funds that pay a daily accrued distribution and funds that do not, the BER can be  calculated as:
